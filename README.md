# SSE659.Project2.Repo
Repository for SSE659 Project 2

This repository was created for a Design Quality & Maintenance course for the purposes of learning and practicing refactoring techniques.

The application in this repository was developed for a previous course. It is a Deli Training Application that is intended to help newly hired Deli workers to be able to identify deli products when they are not in their original packaging. The application is simply a game that consists of two modes, a learning and testing mode. In learning mode the user can browse all of the deli products in their orignial packaging to get aquianted with what each product looks like. In testing mode the user is shown two product images and prompted to select the correct product. The product label is sensored in both images forcing the user to rely on the visual patterns of the product in order to correctly identify it.

The testing mode has two levels of difficulty, easy and hard. When the testing mode is set to easy the program will prompt the user to choose between two products and it will only make sure that those two products are not the same product. When in hard mode the program will prompt the user to choose between two products and will make sure that both products are not the same product but are of the same type. Thus in easy mode the user may have to choose between a Turkey and a Beef product which should be easier to identify, but in hard mode the two images shown will always be of the same type, hence two turkeys, two beef products, two cheese products, etc.

Work to be done:
1. The product images in the "censored images" folder need to be censored with a picture editing software so that the game can be complete. At the time of creating the repo all of the images are uncensored so the game is very easy when in testing mode.
